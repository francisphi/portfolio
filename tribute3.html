<p> I idolize this man because hes good at playing basketball, and i love playing basketball.<br><br> He is a superstar athlete that doesn't have any scandals linked to his name. <br>He married his high school sweet heart and hasn't had any rumors of cheating in the media, <br> which is pretty uncommon among famous athletes.<br><br>

He gives back to the community and has donated millions of dollars to send kids to college. <br>Even his “the decision” ESPN special funds were donated to the Boys and Girls Club Foundation.<br><br>

From a basketball perspective, he is the ultimate team player.<br> He is a rare superstar that finds more joy in helping his teammates succeed instead of personal statistics. <p/>
